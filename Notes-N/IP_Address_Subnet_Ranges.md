# IP Address Subnet Ranges

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Subnet Mask Notation.**

IP Addresses are 32 bits long.

The subnet range syntax `nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/xx` means that the first xx bits are fixed. For example:

- `192.168.0.0/24` - means first 24 bits (the values 192.168.0) are fixed.

- `10.200.0.1/8` - means first 8 bits (the value 10) are fixed.

- `10.138.0.0/20` - means first 20 bits are fixed giving: min IP: `10.138.0.0` - max IP: `10.138.31.255`.
