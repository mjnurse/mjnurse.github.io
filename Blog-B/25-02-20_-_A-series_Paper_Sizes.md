title: 25-02-20 - A-series Paper Sizes
---

## Very Interesting...

If you take a sheet of A-series sized paper and fold it in half, the ratio of `height` to `width` remains the same.

To achieve this the ratio of `height` to `width` is `height = sqrt(2) * width`.

The size (area) of `A0` is 1 square meter, `A1` is 1/2 square meter, ..., `A4` is 1/16 square meter.

There is `A-1` (2 square meters), `A-2` (4 square meters) etc.
