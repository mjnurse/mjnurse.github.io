title: 19-01-14 - snake case
section: Notes
---

Today I learned that the field / variable naming standard I used for 15+ years in Oracle is called `snake_case`. 

I'm wondering if there is a name for `variables-formatted-like-this`?  Maybe that's snake case too.  

`camelCaseFormat` is the most common format I've used outside of Oracle.
