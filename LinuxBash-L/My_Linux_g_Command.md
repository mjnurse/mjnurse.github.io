title: Linux go Script
---

A script that allows me to go to a directory using an alias - eg: `gbin` to go to my `bin` directory.

I name this script `g`.

It contains an alias `ge` which edits the script and an alias `g` which lists all the go to aliases.

The script needs to be `sourced` to set the aliases - eg: `source g` (or `. g`).  I add this to my `.bashrc`.  I also make sure the location of `g` is in my path so I can re-source it after any changes using `. g` (with no path).

```
alias ge="gvim /c/MJN/github/bash/g; echo; echo REMEMBER . g; echo"
alias g="alias | egrep 'alias g.*=' | sed 's/alias //; s/=/              = /; s/\(..........\)[^=]*\(.*\)/\1\2/; /^g /d'"

alias gbash="cd /c/MJN/github/bash; ls"
alias gbin="cd /c/MJN/gdrive/bin; ls"
alias gcli="cd /c/MJN/github/cli-builder; ls"
```
