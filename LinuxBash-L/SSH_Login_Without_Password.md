# PuTTY

## Generate PuTTY Key

Putty (for windows) doesn't support OpenSSH keys directly so we need to create a new ssh key for Putty.  The PuTTYgen tool can do this.

- Open PuTTYgen application

- Click `Conversions` from the PuTTY Key Generator menu and select `Import key`.

- Navigate to the OpenSSH private key and click `Open`.

- Under `Actions` / `Save the generated key`, select `Save private key`.

- Choose an optional passphrase to protect the private key.

- Save the private key as `id_rsa.ppk`.

## Add key to PuTTY

- Enter the remote server Host Name or IP address under `Session`.

- Navigate to `Connection` > `SSH` > `Auth`.

- Click `Browse...` under `Authentication parameters` / `Private key file for authentication`.

- Locate the `id_rsa.ppk` private key and click `Open`.

- Finally, go back to the `Session` on the menu and click `Save`
