# Help

I need somebody<br>
(Help) not just anybody<br>
(Help) you know I need someone, help<br>

So much younger than today<br>
(I never need) I never needed anybody's help in any way<br>
(Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone)<br>
I'm not so self assured<br>
(And now I find) now I find I've changed my mind<br>
And opened up the doors<br>

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
And I do appreciate you being 'round<br>
Help me get my feet back on the ground<br>
Won't you please, please help me<br>

In oh so many ways<br>
(My independ-) my independence seems to vanish in the haze<br>
(But) but every now and then (now and then)<br>
I feel so insecure<br>
(I know that I) I know that I just need you like<br>
I've never done before<br>

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
And I do appreciate you being 'round<br>
Help me get my feet back on the ground<br>
Won't you please, please help me<br>

When I was younger, so much younger than today<br>
I never needed anybody's help in any way<br>
(Now) but now these days are gone (these days are gone)<br>
I'm not so self assured<br>
(And now I find) now I find I've changed my mind<br>
And opened up the doors<br>

Help me if you can, I'm feeling down<br>
And I do appreciate you being 'round<br>
Help me get my feet back on the ground<br>
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, ooh<br>
