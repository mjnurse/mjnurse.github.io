## Basic Objects

- **pod** - container / set of containers + storage resources + unique IP + local options

- **service** - abstraction layer on top of a set of ephemeral pods (think of this as the 'face' of a set of pods)

- **volume** - sometimes-shared, persistent storage

- **namespace** - virtual cluster on top of an underlying physical cluster

## Service Types

- **clusterIP** - exposes services only inside the cluster (default)

- **nodePort** - exposes services at the specified port on all nodes (<node-ip>:<nodePort>)

- **loadBalancer** - exposes the service with a cloud-provider's load balancer.

- **externalName** - this maps a service to endpoints completely outside of the cluster

## Controllers

- **replicaSet** - ensures a certain number of pods are running

- **deployment** - declaratively manages a replicaSet

- **statefulSet** - like a deployment, but for non-interchangeable (or stateful) underlying pods

- **daemonSet** - manages pods that need to run on all/some nodes

- **job** - manages a set of pods that run to completion and tracks the overall progress

## Control Plane

- **master** - entity responsible for managing cluster state. It consists of 3 major components:

   - **kube-apiserver** - exposes cluster control and state

   - **kube-controller-manager** - this is where the 'brain' of controllers live

   - **kube-scheduler** - matches resources to work

- **node** - individual machines or VMs that make up the cluster. A node consists of:

   - **kubelet** - service that communicates with the master

   - **kube-proxy** - proxy for connecting to the cluster network

**namespace** -> virtual cluster on top of an underlying physical cluster
