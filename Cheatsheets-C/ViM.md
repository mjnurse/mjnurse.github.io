| `[0123abAC]` | Matches any of the characters inside the brackets |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9]` | Matches lowercase characters, uppercase characters and digits |
| `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` | Matches anything but [a-zA-Z0-9] "^" will lose its special meaning if it's not the first character in the range. |

## Using Matched Characters In Replacement String

Search strings inside "\(" and "\)" can be used in replacement string reference as \1, \2 etc

Replacement String Special Character

| `\0` | The whole matched pattern |
| `\L` | The following characters are made lowercase (terminate with \E or \e) |
| `\U` | The following characters are made uppercase (terminate with \E or \e) |
| `\l` | Next character made lowercase |
| `\u` | Next character made uppercase |
| `\r` | Split line in two at this point |
| `&` | The whole matched pattern |
| `~` | The previous substitute string |

## Alternations

" | `" can combine several expressions into one. The first one matched will be used.
eg. `\(Date: | Subject: | From:\)\(\s.*\)` - matches Date: or Subject: first then whitespace.

## Regexp Operator Precedence

| 1 | Grouping | `\(\)[a-zA-Z0-9]` |
| 2 | Quantifiers | `\=,\+,*,\{n} etc.` |
| 3 | Characters | Sequence of characters/metacharacters` |
| 4 | Alternation | `[a-zA-Z0-9]` |

## Global Command - Global search and execution

`:<range>g[!]/<pattern>/<cmd>`

Execute the Ex command <cmd> (default ":p") on the lines within <range> where <pattern matches >. !<pattern> only line which don't match.

Example Ex commands :s[ubstitute], :co , :d[elete], :w[rite] etc.

eg. `:g/^$/d` - delete all empty lines in a file.
eg. `:g/^$/,/./-j` - reduce multiple blank lines to a single blank.
eg. `:10,20g/^/ mo 10` - reverse the order of the lines starting from the line 10 up to the line 20.

## Misc

`:set ic` - ignore case, `:set noic`, `:set ic!` - toggle.

## vimrc

`.vimrc` file:
```vim
set hlsearch
set incsearch
set ic
