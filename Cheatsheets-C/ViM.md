### Operator - Text Object - Motion

Text Object: **i**nside, **a**round

Motion:

| `w` | word |
| `W` | WORD (includes special chars) |
| `b` or `(` | block (of parentheses) |
| `B` or `{` | BLOCK (of curly braces) |

## Macros

| `q[a-z]` | Start recording macro named a,b,c..z. q ends recording |
| `@[a-z]` | Replay macro named a,b,c..z |

`:<range>s/<search string>/<replace string>[/cgiI]`

| `c` | Confirm each replacement |
| `g` | All instances on a line |
| `i` | Ignore case (I - don't ignore case) |

## Range

| `num` | An absolute line number |
| `.` | The current line |
| `$` | The last line in the file |
| `%` | The whole file. |
| `'t` | Position of mark "t" |
| `n..m` | Lines numbered n to m inclusive |

## Escaped Characters

| `.` | Any character except new line (.* - includes empty lines) |
| `\.` | . character |
| `\s` | Whitespace character (\S - non-whitespace character) |

| `\{n,m}` | Matches from n to m of the preceding character |
| `\{n}` | Matches exactly n times of the preceding characters |
| `\{,m}` | Matches at most m (from 0 to m) of the preceding characters |
| `\{n,}` | Matches at least n of of the preceding characters |
| `\{-}` | Matches 0 or more of the preceding atom, as few as possible |
| `\{-n,m}` | Matches 1 or more of the preceding characters |
| `\{-n,}` | Matches at lease or more of the preceding characters |
| `\{-,m}` | Matches 1 or more of the preceding characters |

## String Ranges

| `[0123abAC]` | Matches any of the characters inside the brackets |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9]` | Matches lowercase characters, uppercase characters and digits |
| `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` | Matches anything but [a-zA-Z0-9] "^" will lose its special meaning if it's not the first character in the range. |

## Using Matched Characters In Replacement String

Search strings inside "\(" and "\)" can be used in replacement string reference as \1, \2 etc

Replacement String Special Character

| `\0` | The whole matched pattern |
| `\L` | The following characters are made lowercase (terminate with \E or \e) |
| `\U` | The following characters are made uppercase (terminate with \E or \e) |
| `\l` | Next character made lowercase |
| `\u` | Next character made uppercase |
| `\r` | Split line in two at this point |
| `&` | The whole matched pattern |
| `~` | The previous substitute string |

## Alternations

" | `" can combine several expressions into one. The first one matched will be used.
eg. `\(Date: | Subject: | From:\)\(\s.*\)` - matches Date: or Subject: first then whitespace.

## Regexp Operator Precedence

| 1 | Grouping | `\(\)[a-zA-Z0-9]` |
| 2 | Quantifiers | `\=,\+,*,\{n} etc.` |
| 3 | Characters | Sequence of characters/metacharacters` |
| 4 | Alternation | `[a-zA-Z0-9]` |

## Global Command - Global search and execution

`:<range>g[!]/<pattern>/<cmd>`

Execute the Ex command <cmd> (default ":p") on the lines within <range> where <pattern matches >. !<pattern> only line which don't match.

Example Ex commands :s[ubstitute], :co , :d[elete], :w[rite] etc.

eg. `:g/^$/d` - delete all empty lines in a file.
eg. `:g/^$/,/./-j` - reduce multiple blank lines to a single blank.
eg. `:10,20g/^/ mo 10` - reverse the order of the lines starting from the line 10 up to the line 20.

## Misc

`:set ic` - ignore case, `:set noic`, `:set ic!` - toggle.

## vimrc

`.vimrc` file:
```vim
set hlsearch
set incsearch
set ic

" Lets put all the filename~ backup and swp / un file in the temp folder.
