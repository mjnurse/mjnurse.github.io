# Cloud Storage (GCS)

## Overview

- Binary large object storage
- No capacity management.
- Access via unique key (eg URL).
- Not a file system - object can be call files.   Do not use as a file system.
- Immutable - never edit always replace with new.
- Organised by buckets.
  - Globally unique name.
  - Storage Class.
  - Location (region / multi region).
  - IAM policies or ACLs (Access Control Lists).
  - Object versioning setting.
  - Object lifecycle management rules (*eg delete obj's older than 365 days, only keep 3 versions*)

## Storage Classes

- **Multi-Regional** - Most frequent access - avail SLA 99.95% - Content storage and delivery.
  - Two locations > 160km.
  - Main cost per GB per month.

.- **Regional** - Frequent access in a region - avail SLA 99.90% - In region analytics / transcoding.
- **Nearline** - Access avg. > once a month - avail SLA 99.00% - backups, long tail content.
  - Cost includes per GB transferred.

- **Coldline** - Access avg. > once a year - avail SLA 99.00% - archiving, DR.
  - Main cost per GB transferred.
  - Min 90 days storage.

## Integrated with

- **App engine** - Object storage, logs and backups.
- **Compute Engine** - startup scripts, images and general objects.
- **Cloud SQL** - import and export tables.

# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Networks

## Overview

- Contained within in a project.
- Global Scope.
- Two VMs on same network and communicate using internal IP addresses even if they are in different regions.
- Two VMS in the same region but on different networks must use external IP addresses to communicate.  Note - this does not mean they go over the internet but to Google edge routers.
- Subnets in regions and Subnets can span zones.  Subnet are an IP address range.
- Have routing tables to forward traffic.
- Have a global firewalls.
- Have define rules based on metadata tags (eg tag all web servers as web and open all port 80 on these).
- VPC peering - allow two VPC to share traffic.
- Shared VPC.
  
### VPC Types

#### Default

- Every project.
- One subnet per region.
- Default firewalls.

#### Auto Mode

- Default Networking.
- One subnet per region.
- Regional IP allocation.
- Fixed /20 subnet per region.
- In the 10.128.0.0/9 cidr block.
- Expandable to /16.

#### Customer Mode

- No default subnets.
- Full control of IP ranges.
- Regional IP allocation.
- Expandable to any RFC 1918 size. (Note can expand without recreating, can not shrink).

### External IP Addresses

Note: will get charged for these.

- External IP addresses map to internal IP addresses.
- FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name.
- External IP are unknown to the internal OS.
- Allow access from outside the Project.

### Cloud DNS

- GCP DNS translating domain names to IP addresses.

### Alias IP Ranges

- Can assign a range of IP addresses to a single VM.  For example multiple services or containers could each use a different IP address.

### Cloud Load Balancing

- Users get a single, global anycast IP address.
- Cross region load balancing.
- Traffic over Google backbone to closest point-of-presence.
- Traffic route based on backend load.
- Only healthy backends get traffic.
- No pre-warming required.

### 5 VPC Load-balancing Options

(For external traffic)

1. Global HTTP(S) - Layer 7 based on load, Can route different URLS to different backends.

2. Global SSL Proxy - Layer 4 of non-HTTPS SSL based on load.  Supported on specific port numbers.

3. Global TCP Proxy - Layer 4 non-SSL TCP.  Supported on specific port numbers.

4. Regional - Any traffic (TCP, UDP). anycast port number.

(For internal traffic)

5. Regional Internal - Load balancer inside a VPC.  Use for internal tiers of multi-tier apps .  (eg between presentations and business layers).

### Cloud DNS

- Create managed zones then add, edit, delete.
- Programmable using API.

### Cloud CDN (content Delivery Network)

- Uses distributed edge caches to cache content close to users.
- Can use CDN interconnect to use of CDN.

### Interconnect Options

- **VPN** - Secure multi-Gbps over VPN tunnels.

- **Direct Peering** - Private connection between you and Google.  (No SLA).

- **Carrier Peering** - Connect through largest partners network of service providers.

- **Dedicated Interconnect** - Connect N x 10G transport circuits at Google POPs.

### Route and Firewall Rules

#### Routes

- Map traffic to destination Networks.
- Are created when a subnet is created.
- Have Network and Instance tags.  No instance tags then all instances can use it.
- Creates routing tables.
- Apply to traffic egressing a VM.
- Forward traffic to the most specific route.
- Destination is in CIDR notation.
- Enable VMs on the same NW to communicate.

#### Firewall Rules

- VPC networks functions as a distributed firewall.
- Are applied to NW as a whole.
- Connections allowed / disallowed and an instance level.
- Are stateful.  Once traffic allow, subsequent traffic allowed.
- Implied deny all ingress allow all egress even if all firewall rules deleted.

#### Firewall Parameters

`direction` - inbound rules matched against **ingress** and outbound rules matched against **egress**

`source` or `destination` - for ingress source can be specified with IP address's, source tags or a source service account.  For egress the destination can be specified with (see ingress).

`protocol` and `port` - Can restrict on protocol or protocol and port.

`action` - allow or deny packets.

`priority` - The order the rules are evaluated until the first matching rule is found.

**Rule Assignment** - rules can be assigned to all instances or specific instances.

With out any firewall there is an implied deny all ingress  allow all egress rule.

#### GCP Firewall use case: Egress

**Conditions:**
- Destination CIDR ranges.
- Protocols.
- Ports.

**Action:**
- Allow: permit the matching egress connection.
- Deny: block the matching egress connection.
  
#### GCP Firewall use case: Ingress

Protect against incoming connections.

**Conditions:**
- Destination CIDR ranges.
- Protocols.
- Ports.

**Action:**
- Allow: permit the matching ingress connection.
- Deny: block the matching ingress connection.

#### Default Firewalls

### Pricing

**Ingress** not charged unless a load balancer.

**Egress** not charged where:
- To same zone (internal IP).
- To Google product (YouTube, Maps etc).
- To different GCP service (within same regions - some exceptions).

**Egress** is charged:
- Between zones in the same region (per GB).
- To the same zone (external IP) (per GB).
- Between regions (per GB).

**External Ip Addresses** charges (as of 2021):
- Static External IP assign but unused $0.010.
- Static and Ephemeral on standard machines $0.004.
- Static and Ephemeral on preemptible machines $0.002.
- Static and Ephemeral attatched to forwarding rules: no charge.

# Managed Services

We have:

### IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

Cloud provides: VMs.

We are responsible for: Application Code and Runtime, Configuring load balancing, Auto scaling, OS upgrades and patches, Availability, etc..

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

Cloud provides: OS (incl. upgrades and patches), Application Runtime, Auto scaling, Availability & Load balancing etc..

we are responsible for: Configuration (of Application and Services), Application code.

Also:

- CaaS (Container as a Service) - containers instead of apps.
- FaaS (Function as a Service) - functions instead of apps.
- Databases - Relational & NoSQL (Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL Database etc) 
- Queues, AI, ML, Operations, etc..

### Serverless

We don't need to worry about servers, OS, scaling, availability.

Typically pay for use - no use - no cost.
