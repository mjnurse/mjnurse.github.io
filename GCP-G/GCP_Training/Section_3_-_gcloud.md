# Instance Groups

### Two Types of Instance Groups:

**Managed** : *Identical* VMs created using an instance template:
- Features: Auto scaling, auto healing and managed releases.
- All instances must be same machine type.

**Unmanaged** : Different configuration for VMs in same group:
- Does NOT offer auto scaling, auto healing & other services.
- NOT Recommended unless you need different kinds of VMs.

Can be in a single Zone or over a Region.

## Managed Instance Groups

- Maintain certain number of instances (If an instance crashes, MIG launches another instance).
- Detect application failures using health checks (Self Healing).
- Increase and decrease instances based on load (Auto Scaling).
- Add Load Balancer to distribute load.
- Create instances in multiple zones (regional MIGs).
  - Regional MIGs provide higher availability compared to zonal MIGs.
- Release new application versions without downtime.
  - Rolling updates: Release new version step by step (gradually). Update a percentage of instances to the new version at a time.
  - Canary Deployment: Test new version with a group of instances before.
releasing it across all instances.

### Auto Scaling

Can configure:

- Minimum number of instances.
- Maximum number of instances.
- Autoscaling metrics: 
  - CPU Utilization target or Load Balancer Utilization target or Any other metric from Stack Driver.
  - Cool-down period: How long to wait before looking at auto scaling metrics again? (to prevent frequent scaling up / down).
  - Scale In Controls: Prevent a sudden drop in no of VM instances (Example: Don't scale in by more than 10% or 3 instances in 5 minutes).

### Rolling Updates

- Replace instance template with a new template.
  - Can replace instances (create new, delete old).
  - Can restart instances (so instance will be temporarily unavailable).
  - Can use canary testing (test 'n' instances and if good update all).
  - Maximum surge: How many instances are added at any point in time? (how many temporary additional instances above the current number).
  - Maximum unavailable: How many instances can be offline during the update? (set this to 0 for no reduction in capacity - therefore new instances added before current instances removed).

# Cloud Load Balancing

Distributes user traffic across instances of an application in single region or multiple regions.

- Fully distributed, software defined managed service.
- Important Features: 
  - Health check - Route to healthy instances.
  - Recover from failures.
  - Auto Scaling.
  - Global load balancing with single anycast IP (Also supports internal load balancing).
- Enables:
  - High Availability.
  - Auto Scaling.
  - Resiliency.

- Load balancer can be:
  - HTTP(s).
  - TCP (TCP LB, SSL proxy, TCP proxy).
  - UDP (single region only).

- Load balance can be:
  - Internal.
  - External (external IP).

- Can load balance based on:
  - Instance Utilization.
  - Request Rate (ie maximum requests per second per instance).

## Need to Configure 

- Backend - Group of endpoints that receive traffic from a Google Cloud load balancer (example: instance groups).
  - Note can have multiple backends (multiple instance groups).
- Frontend - Specify an IP address, port and protocol. This IP address is the frontend IP for your clients requests.
  - For SSL, a certificate must also be assigned.
- Host and path rules (For HTTP(S) Load Balancing) - Define rules redirecting the traffic to different backends:
  - Based on path - xxx.com/a vs xxx.com/b
  - Based on Host - a.xxx.com vs b.xxx.com
  - Based on HTTP headers (Authorization header) and methods (POST, GET, etc).
  - etc.

### SSL/TLS Termination/Offloading

- Client to LB: HTTPS/TLS.
- LB to VM: HTTP/TCP.

LB is performing Termination/Offloading.  This reduces load on the VM instances as they don't need to manage SSL.

## Choosing a Load Balancer

## Cloud Load Balancing Features

Load Balancer | Traffic Type | Proxy/Pass-through | Dest' Ports
--------------|--------------|--------------------|------------
External HTTP(S) | Global, External, HTTP(S) | Proxy | HTTP 80/8080, HTTPS 443
Internal HTTP(S) | Regional, Internal, HTTP(S) | Proxy | HTTP 80/8080, HTTPS 443
SSL Proxy | Global, External, TCP with SSL offload | Proxy | Many
TCP Proxy | Global, External, TCP without SSL offload | Proxy | Many
External NW TCP/UDP | Regional, External, TCP/UDP | Pass-through | Any
Internal NW TCP/UDP | Regional, Internal, TCP/UDP | Pass-through | Any

## Load Balancing Across Multiple Instance Groups in Multiple regions

- Regional MIG can distribute instances in different zones of a single region (in the same project).
- HTTP(S) Load Balancing can distribute load to the multiple MIGs behind a **single external** IP address.
  - User requests are redirected to the nearest region (Low latency).
- Load balancing sends traffic to healthy instances:
  - If health check fails instances are restarted. (Ensure that health check from load balancer can reach the instances in an instance group (Firewall rules)).
  - If all backends within a region are unhealthy, traffic is distributed to healthy backends in other regions.
  - Note: Can contain preemptible instances.

### Load Balancing Scenarios

- Backend Service - Group of backends or a bucket (Each Backend Service can have multiple backends in multiple regions).
- Backend - A Managed Instance Group.
- URL Maps - Route requests to backend services or backend buckets eg.
  - URL /service-a maps to Backend Service A.
  - URL /service-b maps to Backend Service B.

#### Scenario 1 - Multi Regional Microservice

- One Backend Service (for the Microservice).
- Multiple Backends (one for each MIG in each region).
- Single URL Map - to the Backend Service.
- Global routing - you to the nearest regional MIG.
  - Note: Needs Premium Networking Tier (Standard tier only allows single region).

#### Scenario 2 - Multiple Microservices

- Multiple Backend Services (one per Microservice).
- multiple Backend (each Microservice can have multiple MIGs multiple regions).
- URL Map for each Microservice backend (e.g `URL /service-a`).

# Availability

- 99.99% - four 9's availability - 4.5 minutes downtime a month.
- 99.999% - 26 seconds downtime per month.

## Highly Available Architecture:

- Multiple Regional Instance Groups for each Microservice.
- Distribute Load using a Global HTTPS Load Balancing.
- Configure Health Checks for Instance Group and Load Balancing.
- Enable Live Migration for VM instances.

Advantages:
- Instances distributed across regions - even if a region is down, your app is available.
- Global Load Balancing is highly available.
- Health checks ensure auto healing.

# Scalability

- Vertical Scaling - increase machine size.
- Horizontal Scaling - auto scale Managed Instance Group, distribute load using a Load Balancer.

# Live Migration

- Running instance is migrated to another host in the same zone.
- Does NOT change any attributes or properties of the VM.
- SUPPORT for instances with local SSDs.
- NO SUPPORT for GPUs and preemptible instances.

Availability Policy:
- On host maintenance: What should happen during periodic infrastructure maintenance?
  - Migrate (default): Migrate VM instance to other hardware.
  - Terminate: Stop the VM instance (required for VMs with GPU).
- Automatic restart - Restart VM instances if they are terminated due to non-user-initiated reasons (maintenance event, hardware failure etc).

# Security

- Use Firewall Rules to restrict traffic.
- Use Internal IP Addresses as much as possible.
- Use Sole-tenant nodes when you have regulatory needs.
- Create a hardened custom image to launch your VMs.

# Performance

- Use GPUs to accelerate machine learning and data processing workloads.
- Use TPUs for massive matrix operations performed in your machine learning workloads.
- Prefer creating a hardened custom image to installing software at startup.

# Resiliency

- Build Resilient Architectures (run VMs in MIG behind global load balancing).
- Have the right data available:
  - Use Cloud Monitoring for monitoring.
  - Install logging agent to send logs to Cloud Logging.
- Be prepared for the unexpected (and changes)
  - Enable Live Migration and Automatic restart when available.
  - Configure the right health checks.
  - DR- Up to date image copied to multiple regions.

# Sustained Use Discounts

- Automatic discounts for running VM instances for significant portion of the billing month.
- Example: If you use N1, N2 machine types for more than 25% of a month, you get a 20% to 50% discount on every incremental minute.
- Discount increases with usage.
- No action required on your part.
- Applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine.
- Does NOT apply on certain machine types (eg. E2, A2) or instances created by App Engine flexible and Dataflow.

# Committed Use Discounts

- For predictable requirements.
- 1 - 3 years.
- Up to 70% discount (certain machine types / GPUs).
- Applicable for instances created by Google Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine.
- NOT applicable for instances created by App Engine flexible and Dataflow.

# Preemptible VMs

- Up to 80% saving.
- Can be killed at anytime within 24 hours - Instances get 30 second warning.

# Billing

- Billed by second (minimum 1 minute).
- Not billed when VM stopped (storage billed).
- Create budgets alerts.
- Use auto scaling to have optimal number of VMs running.
