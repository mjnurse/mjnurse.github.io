This perhaps the oldest page on this website and its predecessors.  It is, as it says, a history of the cars I've owned.

# Best Car

## Audi S5 Quattro

![](images/AudiS5-350x250.jpg)

**354bhp, 369lb-ft, 0-60mph: 4.7s, Top Speed: 155mph.**

A great car, very quick, accelerates hard in any gear.  The exhaust growls in sports mode.  The 8 speed auto gearbox changes very quickly - gear change let down my A5 V6 TDi Quattro, and this was the first thing I checked on the test drive.  Came with almost every extra including massaging heated front seats and Android Auto which means integrated Google Maps, Spotify etc.

I bought this at 2 years old but it was immaculate.  This is the best car I've had pushing my Audi S3 into second place.

**Previous Best Car:** Audi S3.

# First Car

## Austin Metro

![](images/Metro-350x250.jpg)

**41bhp, 53lb-ft. 0-60mph: 18.2s. Top Speed: 86mph.**

This car looks boring now - it looked boring then but, it was reliable, cheap to run and fairly spacious. Heated rear window? No. Radio? No.

Once tried to drive through a flood. The water got so deep that I lost sight of the road and drove into the ditch. Water rushed in up to the height of the steering wheel. A perfect combination of plastic seats, nylon carpets and no electronics meant its dried out, and no one ever knew.

# Worst Car

## Ford Escort Encore 1.6

![](images/Escort-350x250.jpg)

**89bhp. 96lb-ft. 0-60mph: 11.5s. Top Speed: 110mph.**

I had a VW Golf 1.3. I wanted something quicker. This was the young man's (easier to insure) Ford Escort XR3. Bought it from a garage and took out the garage car loan.

Within weeks I HATED this car, I hated the garage and I was trapped with a loan. Door and boot locks broke. Horn would come on for no good reason. Everything creaked. Awful car. Bought tears to my eyes.

# Quickest Car

## Polestar 2 Dual Motor Long Range

![](images/Polestar2-350x239.jpg)

**416bhp, 546lb-ft, 0-60mph: 4.3s, Top Speed: 127mph.**

An electric car.  Came with the Pilot and Plus packs.  Harman Kardon sound system, panoramic glass roof.

**Previous Quickest Car:** Audi S5.

# Current Car

## Polestar 2 Dual Motor Long Range

![](images/Polestar2-350x239.jpg)

**416bhp, 546lb-ft, 0-60mph: 4.3s, Top Speed: 127mph.**

An electric car.  Came with the Pilot and Plus packs.  Harman Kardon sound system, panoramic glass roof.

![](images/Q7-300x214.jpg)

**228bhp. 369lb-ft. 0-60mph: 8.4s. Max: 137mph.**

Bought this car for the 7 seats and soon after most the children were too old to want to go anywhere with us.  Was 10 years old when I bought it, but it was like new inside.  Great car, but to big to use every day.
