  "body": "section Misc Today I was looking at authentication for a web-service It was using JSON Web Tokens What are JWTs How do they work A JWT is a cryptographically signed JSON token used to authenticate users making calls to an application A JWT is sent to a user when they authenticate with an authentication Service The user can send this token with requests to an application web-service or other as proof of identity The application talks to the authentication server and is told the how the token was cryptographically signed and the key used This allows the application to be sure that the token is valid and originated from the authentication service Two types of cryptographic signatures can be used - Symmetric hash algorythm - where the same key is used to sign and assure the JWT - Asymmetric hash algorythm public private key - Where a private key is used to sign the JWT and a public key is used to assure the JWT Symmetric hashes are much quicker to compute than Asymmetric hashes but mean the secret key will need to be shared with all applications which need to authenticate users The contents of a JWT A JWT is made up from 3 components Header The header describes how the JWT was computed A typical header will contain typ JWT alg HS256 The key value typ specifies that this is a JWT The key value alg specifies that this JWT was signed using the symmetric HMAC-SHA256 algorithm The header JSON is converted to a url encoded string using base64urlEncode Payload also called the Claims The payload contains the information which is asserted claimed to be true This could contain userId martin-98999394 exp 15634343 The free form key value userId could specify the Id of the user which the JWT asserts is authorised A request from that userId along with the JWT would authenticate that user The key value exp which is one of a set of standard keys specifies when the JWT expires The payload JSON is converted to a url encoded string using base64urlEncode Signature The signature is created by appending the payload url encoded string to the header url encoded string separated by a and then hashing this value using the specified algorithm and secret The hash value is then also converted to a url encoded string using base64urlEncode and then append to the header payload string again separated by a Creating the JWT using a symmetric hash algorithm As pseudo we have body base64urlEncode headerJSON base64urlEncode payloadJSON signature base64urlEncode hash algorithm body secret key JWT body signature The JWT will look something like eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItO GZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ NOTE - The payload is NOT encrypted it is simply converted to base64url encoding and can be reversed - If the contents of the JWT are modified in anyway then the signature will not longer match the contents Assuring the JWT The application to which the JWT is passed to authenticate the user will split JWT header payload signature body header payload new signature base64urlEncode hash algorithm body secret key if new signature matches signature then JWT is valid NOTE - The JWT assurance process recomputes the hash of header and payload using the same secret key as the process that created the JWT - The payload can now be converted back to JSON to allow the application to check it has not expired and to get the authenticated userId - If the secret key is known by a third party the third party can also create valid JWTs so the secret must not be shared Using an Asymmetric Hash Algorithm When symmetric hash algorithms are used the authentication service needs to share the secret key used to create the signature with the applications services which need to assure the JWT This is a security risk as the key could be maliciously use to create new JWTs An Asymmetric encryption algorithm allows the signature to be created encrypted using a private key when the JWT is created To assure the JWT the application service can decrypt the signature using the public key The application can then compare this to the header and payload to assure the JWT is valid As pseudo code Creating a JWT body base64urlEncode headerJSON base64urlEncode payloadJSON signature base64urlEncode hash algorithm encode body private key JWT body signature Assuring the JWT split JWT header payload signature body header payload decoded signature hash algorithm decode base64urlDecode signature public key if decoded signature matches the body then JWT is valid In this case we can be sure that the service which created the JWT knows the private key For the signature to be successfully decrypted using the public key it MUST of be created using the private key hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 20 12 22 10 43 p  Blog - 19-02-14 - JWT - JSON Web Tokens"

  "body": "section Misc For a long time I ve wanted to explore using statistics to determine how many tests are needed to test for errors The question I have is that for a set of n records if we want to be say 99 9 sure none contain an error how many would be need to test at random to reach a point where we can be statistically say 99 9 sure there are no errors The Basics Tests with a fixed number of options records to test If I have a die and there is a chance the number has not been printed on one side how many times would I need to roll the die to be 99 sure all sides contain a number Lets assume there is a fault on one side of the die and I can only see the top face of the die each time I roll it - how many times would I need to roll the die to be 99 sure I ll find it This isn t easy to calculate We need to work out all the combinations of die sides on top after n throws These will include throws with our bad side on top First Roll - 6 options 1 is the bad side so chance of finding it is 1 6 Calculation - 1 6 16 7 Second Roll - If role 1 finds a bad side then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If roll one finds a good side there is a 5 6 chance of this we roll again - The second roll has a 1 6 chance of being bad Calculation - 1 6 5 6 x 1 6 30 6 Third Roll - If role 1 finds a bad side then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If roll 1 finds a good side there is a 5 6 chance of this we roll again - Roll 2 roll has a 1 6 chance of being bad if we find bad side we stop - If role 2 finds a good side there is a 5 6 chance of this we roll again - Roll 3 has a 1 6 chance of being bad Calculation - 1 6 5 6 x 1 6 5 6 x 1 6 42 1 This gets very complicated very quick However this question can be reversed and instead we can ask - What is the chance that each time I roll the die I won t find the bad side For each roll of the die there is a 5 6 83 3 chance I won t find the bad side and that is true for every roll of the die regardless of the outcome of any earlier rolls However if we ask the question up front What is the chance I won t find the bad side within say 3 rolls then the maths is slightly different For 3 planned rolls the chance I won t find the faulty side is 5 6 x 5 6 x 5 6 125 216 57 9 This means the chance that I will find the faulty side is 100 - 57 9 42 1 This matches the value calculated above So lets see how many times I would need to plan to roll the die to be 99 sure I ll find the faulty side Roll Number Chance Wont Find Chance Will Find ------------- --------------------------------------- ---------------------- 1 5 6 83 3 16 7 2 5 6 x 5 6 5 6 sup 2 sup 69 4 30 6 3 5 6 sup 3 sup 57 9 98 5 24 5 6 sup 24 sup 1 5 98 5 25 5 6 sup 25 sup 1 3 98 7 26 5 6 sup 26 sup 1 0 99 0 A surprisingly large number This number is large because the number of options sides to land face up for each roll remains the same We can never rule out and remove any side from the next roll Tests with a reducing number of options records to test If we swap the die analogy for a bag containing six balls where ideally all the balls in the bag are white but there is a possibility that one of the balls is black how many balls would I need to take out of the bag to be 99 sure there are no black balls The statistics here are slightly different and there is also the obvious upper limit Once I have removed all the balls 6 balls 6 tests if they are all white I can be 100 sure there no black balls Let s assume one ball is black and do the do the math Again we focus on the chance of finding the bad ball which is far more simple in terms of the math Looking at each test in turn Ball 1 - For ball 1 taken from the bag there is a 1 6 chance it will be black Calculation 1 6 16 7 Ball 2 - If ball 1 is black then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If ball 1 is white there is a 5 6 chance of this we take out ball 2 - For ball 2 there is a 1 5 chance of it being black Calculation 1 6 5 6 x 1 5 33 3 Ball 3 - If ball 1 is black then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If ball 1 is white there is a 5 6 chance of this we take ball 2 - Ball 2 has a 1 5 chance of being black if we find it we stop - If ball 2 is white there is a 4 5 chance of this we take ball 3 - Ball 3 has a 1 6 chance of being black Calculation 1 6 5 6 x 1 5 4 5 x 1 4 55 3 Again using the won t find calculation and asking the question up front how many balls will I need to remove to be 99 sure there isn t a black ball the math is Ball Number Chance Wont Find Chance Will Find ------------- --------------------------------------- -------------------- 1 83 3 5 6 16 7 2 66 7 5 6 x 4 5 33 3 3 50 0 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 50 0 4 33 3 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 x 2 3 66 7 5 16 7 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 x 2 3 x 1 2 83 3 6 0 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 x 2 3 x 1 2 x 0 1 100 The number of balls is too small to get to 99 we hit 100 first Here s What We Know So Far If we choose a percentage p likelihood of there being a bad side bad ball bad record in a set we can calculate how many records we need to look at to be t sure we will find it and if we don t find it we can be 100 - t sure it doesn t exist The maths differs depending on whether we can or can t remove each record from the set if we test it and its good The above examples had a set of 6 sides items records and the two records remain or removed equations gave very different results but as the set side increases the difference between the 2 should decrease Lets write a python program to test this assumption The Python programs is stats test py attatchments stats test py The Statistics Running stats test py python3 stats test py Usage 1 stats test py bad record perc set size target certainty perc 2 stats test py -g 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Where 1 -

reached target certainty 99 0 after 6 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 0 after 26 tests Now lets calculate something a little more useful Assuming we have 100 000 000 records and we want to be 99 99 sure the risk of an error is less than 0 01 python3 stats test py 0 01 100000000 99 99 bad record likelihood 0 01 set size 100000000 target certainty 99 99 With good recs removed - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92057 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92099 tests So we need to test a little over 92 000 records chosen at random from 100 000 000 records to be 99 99 sure there is less than 0 01 of records in error Also note that with this large set size the difference between the number of tests required if the good records are left in or removed is negligible Lets try a larger set size 100 000 000 000 python3 stats test py 0 01 100000000000 99 99 bad record likelihood 0 01 set size 100000000000 target certainty 99 99 With good recs removed - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92099 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92099 tests What s interesting here is that the number if tests with good records remaining in the data set is the same even though we have 1 000x more records This surprised me at first but the reason is obvious once seen As we are stating the max likelihood of there being a bad records as a percentage of the total data set as the set size increase so does the number of bad records If we reduce the bad record likelihood percentage value by a factor of 1 000 so that the max number of bad records in the same as was in the 100 000 000 test set then the number of test should go up python3 stats test py 0 00001 100000000000 99 99 bad record likelihood 1e-05 set size 100000000000 target certainty 99 99 With good recs removed -

  "body": " Introduction What are LDAP and SAML LDAP Overview Lightweight Directory Access Protocol - a protocol to access a directory service such as MS Active Directory LDAP Operation Types Here are some basic operation types in LDAP Bind Authentication When you create a session by connecting to an LDAP server the session s default authentication state is anonymous The LDAP bind feature validates the authentication state and changes it from anonymous Bind can occur either through the Simple or SASL Simple Authentication and Security Layer authentication method Unbind Unbind aborts outstanding operations and ends their connections You can accomplish the same thing by closing the connection Unbind is preferred because it frees up resources that may remain assigned to the aborted operation Add Add new entries to the directory-server database If the added name already exists the server won t accept the entry Instead it will deliver an entryAlreadyExists notification Modify LDAP clients use the modify feature to edit information already stored in a database Only three types of modifications are permissible Adding a new value to the data Replacing or overwriting an existing value and Deleting an existing value Search and Compare The operation lets clients search for and read entries You can search for entries based on their name size scope type and other attributes The compare feature makes it easy to verify whether a named entry has specific attributes Delete Clients use this feature to delete entries from the directory Note that deletion will not occur unless the client sends a perfectly composed delete request to the server Some of the features the delete request must have are The name of the entry you want to erase Attached request controls Levels of LDAP Directory A typical LDAP configuration follows a tree hierarchy format Below are the hierarchy levels from start to end - The starting place - a root directory - Countries - Organizations or companies - Divisions departments and other organizational units - People files and shared resources printers computers and so on You can distribute an LDAP directory across several servers Queries from the clients are distributed across the multiple servers with the help of replication LDAP Data Components Several components work together for LDAP to complete its myriad of tasks especially when it comes to how it queries and displays data to users The most essential of these components are Attributes The actual data within an LDAP system are stored as attributes Each attribute is associated with an attribute type that specifies how clients and the directory server should interact with that attribute Also attribute values contain most of the data that users store and access in LDAP systems Entries Attributes define the characteristics of a user or item while an entry describes the user or item by listing all of their attributes under a name On their own attributes have limited functions You have to associate an attribute with an entry before you can fully utilize it Data Information Tree DIT Within an LDAP system the data defined by attributes represent only a fraction of an object s available information The remaining information is obtainable from the entry s placement within the LDAP system and the relationships its placement suggests For example if you have an entry for inventoryItems and another for people the data entered under each one will provide a better idea of what each entry represents Every entry in an LDAP system is set up as branches on Data Information Trees DITs Since every entry in an LDAP tree can symbolize almost anything users mostly use entries for keeping things organized Schemas Schema is a construct where related ObjectClasses and attribute definitions go under the same category One DIT can have several unrelated schemas for generating the entries and attributes it needs Is LDAP secure LDAP authentication provides standard security with an built-in layer of access management Malicious actors may still eavesdrop during data transmission between Active Directory and clients Optimize security by adding SSL TLS encryption to the LDAP authentication process which makes information transmitted during the authentication process less vulnerable by encrypting communications The default LDAP port used for authentication Port 389 does not have its own security Create a secure connection by adding security extensions such as the LDAPv3 TLS extension or StartTLS mode SAML vs LDAP LDAP and SAML are both authentication protocols that help applications access IT resources SAML sends user information to your identity provider and other online applications while LDAP facilitates on-prem authentication and other server processes Most organizations combine the use of SAML LDAP and other authentication protocols to access various types of IT resources and achieve their business objectives Kerberos vs LDAP Kerberos is a single sign-on and authentication protocol for managing credentials securely It lets a process connect to an authentication server and provides signed and encrypted tickets for accessing files applications and other resources LDAP on the other hand facilitates accessing OpenLDAP Active Directory and other directories It authenticates connections by cross-checking usernames and passwords stored in the LDAP directory Since Kerberos is more secure than LDAP and LDAP has more functions than Kerberos most organizations use both protocols hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 22 03 29 14 27 p  Blog -

  "body": " Comma A comma marks a slight break between different parts of a sentence Used properly commas make the meaning of sentences clear by grouping and separating words phrases and clauses Using commas in lists You need to put a comma between the different items in a list e g - Saturday morning started with a hearty breakfast of scrambled eggs bacon sausage and French toast Using commas in direct speech When a writer quotes a speaker s words exactly as they were spoken this is known as direct speech If the piece of direct speech comes after information about who is speaking you need to use a comma to introduce the direct speech The comma comes before the first quotation mark - Steve replied No problem Note The final quotation mark follows the full stop at the end of the direct speech The reverse is also true - I don t agree I replied Here we are they said Note In this case the comma goes inside the quotation mark There are two exceptions to this rule If a piece of direct speech takes the form of a question or an exclamation you should end it with a question mark or an exclamation mark rather than a comma - Stop him she shouted Did you see that he asked Both rules in one sentence - Yes he said and I always keep my promises Using commas to separate clauses Commas are used to separate clauses in a complex sentence i e a sentence which is made up of a main clause and one or more subordinate clauses e g - Having had lunch we went back to work subordinate clause main clause - I first saw her in Paris where I lived in the early nineties main clause subordinate clause A subordinate clause beginning with who which that whom or where is known as a relative clause The following is a non-restrictive relative clause this could be removed and the sentence still has meaning - Mary who has two young children has a part-time job in the library clause non-restrictive relative clause clause There are also restrictive relative clauses is these are removed then the sentence doesn t make sense e g - Passengers who have young children may board the aircraft first clause restrictive relative clause clause If you left the restrictive relative clause out the sentence wouldn t make much sense It would become Passengers may board the aircraft first You should not put commas round a restrictive relative clause Using commas to mark off parts of a sentence Commas are used to separate a part of a sentence that is an optional aside and not part of the main statement - Gunpowder is not of course a chemical compound - His latest film Calypso Dreams opens next month If you aren t sure whether you ve used a pair of commas correctly try replacing them with brackets or removing the information enclosed by the commas altogether and then see if the sentence is still understandable or if it still conveys the meaning you intended Using a comma with however You should use a comma after however when however means by contrast or on the other hand - However a good deal of discretion is left in the hands of area managers Don t use a comma after however when it means in whatever way - However you look at it existing investors are likely to lose out Apostrophe There are two main cases where an apostrophe is used to show possession and show omission Apostrophes showing possession You use an apostrophe to show that a thing or person belongs or relates to someone or something instead of saying the party of Ben or the weather of yesterday you can write Ben s party and yesterday s weather Here are the main guidelines for using apostrophes to show possession Singular nouns and most personal names With a singular noun or most personal names add an apostrophe plus s - We met at Ben s party - The dog s tail wagged rapidly - Yesterday s weather was dreadful Personal names that end in -s With personal names that end in -s add an apostrophe plus s when you would naturally pronounce an extra s if you said the word out loud - He joined Charles s army in 1642 - Thomas s brother was injured in the accident Note that there are some exceptions to this rule especially in names of places or organizations for example - St Thomas Hospital With personal names that end in -s but are not spoken with an extra s just add an apostrophe after the -s - The court dismissed Bridges appeal - Connors finest performance was in 1991 Plural nouns that end in -s With a plural noun that already ends in -s add an apostrophe after the s - The mansion was converted into a girls school - The work is due to start in two weeks time - My duties included cleaning out the horses stables Plural nouns that do not end in -s With a plural noun that doesn t end in -s add an apostrophe plus s - The children s father came round to see me - He employs 14 people at his men s clothing store Apostrophes showing omission An apostrophe can be used to show that letters or numbers have been omitted Here are some examples of apostrophes that indicate missing letters - I m - short for I am - He ll - short for he will - She d - short for she had or she would - Pick n mix - short for pick and mix - 89 short for 1989 Apostrophes and plural forms You should not use an apostrophe to form the plurals of nouns abbreviations or dates made up of numbers just add -s or -es if the noun in question forms its plural with -es For example - Euro - euros e g The cost of the trip is 570 euros - pizza - pizzas e g Traditional Italian pizzas are thin and crisp - MP - MPs e g Local MPs are divided on this issue - 1990 - 1990s e g The situation was different in the 1990s You can use an apostrophe to show the plurals of single letters or numbers - I ve dotted the i s and crossed the t s - Find all the p s in appear - Find all the number 7 s Colon There are three main uses of the colon 1 - between two main clauses in cases where the second clause explains or follows from the first - That is the secret of my extraordinary life always do the unexpected - It wasn t easy to begin with I had to find the right house 2 - to introduce a list - The price includes the following travel to London flight to Venice hotel accommodation and excursions 3 - before a quotation and sometimes before direct speech - The headline read Taxi Driver Battles Gangsters - They shouted Our families are starving We need land Semicolon The main task of the semicolon is to mark a break that is stronger than a comma but not as final as a full stop It s used between two main clauses that balance each other and are too closely linked to be made into separate sentences as in these two examples - The road runs through a beautiful wooded valley the railway line follows it - An art director searched North Africa I went to the Canary Islands You can also use a semicolon as a stronger division in a sentence that already contains commas - The study showed the following 76 of surveyed firms monitor employee Web-surfing activities with 65 blocking access to unauthorized Internet locations over one-third of the firms monitor employee computer keystrokes half reported storing and reviewing employee emails 57 monitor employee telephone behaviour including the inappropriate use of voicemail Affect or Effect Affect and effect are different in meaning though frequently confused Affect is chiefly used as a verb and its main meaning is to influence or make a difference to - The pay increase will greatly affect their lifestyle - The dampness began to affect my health - The weather will affect my plans for the weekend Effect is used as both a noun and a verb although is more commonly used as a noun As a noun it means a result or an influence - Move the cursor until you get the effect you want - The beneficial effects of exercise are well documented - Over time the effect of loud music can damage your hearing When used as a verb effect means to bring something about as a result It s most often used in a formal context as oppose to everyday English - Growth in the economy can only be effected by stringent economic controls - The new policies did little to effect change - The prime minister effected many policy changes Into or in to Into has several meanings mainly relating to movement action or change - Describing movement or action that results in someone or something becoming enclosed surrounded by or being in contact with something else Martin put the wine into the fridge Pat crashed into another car - Towards the direction of something the main road leads into the city centre - Expressing a change of state the peaceful demo turned into a violent confrontation - Showing the result of an action the minister was forced into a public apology - About or relating to something an investigation into the incident is under way - Used when dividing numbers two goes into six three times - Used informally to mean actively interested in something she s into running Examples Correct - The second half of the film degenerates into a series of sketches - They finally gave in to his demands Incorrect - I got in to my car and zoomed off home - The plane flew in to Gatwick an hour late - She was brought into work on costume design - He s really in to tennis Lead or Led Lead is a metal When it s a verb lead is the present and led is the past tense The problem is that the past tense is pronounced exactly like the above-mentioned metal so people confuse the two In a sentence like She led us to the scene of the crime always use the three-letter spelling hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 22 05 03 14 55 p  Cheatsheets -

  "body": " A High Level Overview of Elasticsearch Structure - Elasticsearch creates manages and searches Indexes - Indexes are stored on Nodes - Multiple Nodes make up a Cluster - A Cluster is identified by a unique name - A Node is a member of one Cluster and is identified by a name defaulting to a random UUID - Universally Unique Identifier - A Node runs on a Server a Server can host multiple Nodes - Indexes are logically and physically split into Shards horizontal scaling - Multiple replicas of a Shard can be created vertical scaling Replicas can protect against Server loss outage - One or more Shards are written to a Node - Each Shard is a Lucene Index - Each Lucene Index is split into Segments - A Segment is created when a write opens commits or closes - Segments are immutable - Segments are akin to mini Indexes - Lucene Indexes are Inverted Indexes - terms map to documents document ids and perhaps locations within Terms are stored in alpha-numeric order and can be stored in a number of formats An ordered lists of terms is good for finding word but not word which would mean searching all terms To support performant word searches terms are also stored in reverse order Other manipulations of terms are done to support other complex searches - for example geo-location number ranges and more Historically Elasticsearch contained Mapping Types These a being deprecated from v6 0 0 onwards Mapping Types described the format of Documents in an Index and an Index could contain multiple types From v6 0 0 onwards an Index can only contain a single Document type This is typically called doc but can be given a different name Operations Add Document - Add new Document requests are first appended to a transaction log a fast operation Documents are then indexed slower operation - When new Documents are added to an Index they are first stored in memory and then Flushed to disk as a new Index Segment - Documents are added to the Index as new Segments in batches using the DocumentWriter - Using default Routing Documents are stored on routed to a Shard based on a document id hash - Custom routing can be used to Route documents to a particular Shard and it s replica based on a mapping for example document author Delete Document - To Delete a document from the index the document is marked as deleted in a bitmap file Update Document - Index updates are a Delete flagged as deleted and an Insert into a new Segment Search - STEP 0 Check the query cache for results - STEP 1 The query is sent to either all Shards default Routing or a particular Shard Custom Routing - STEP 2 Within a shard all Index Segments are read Sequentially for the search term s - STEP 3 Any documents flagged as deleted are removed from the results Percolator Think of this as the reverse operation of what elasticsearch does by nature instead of sending docs indexing them and then running queries one sends queries registers them and then sends docs and finds out which queries match that doc Maintenance Index Segment Merges automatic - but can be triggered using the API - Lucene will automatically Merge Segments removing Deleted documents in the process - A number of index settings can alter when Segments are Merged - Merging effort needs to be balanced against Search effort over multiple segments Slow Queries A good way to know which queries take the more time is by using Elasticsearch slow queries logs PUT index settings index search slowlog threshold query warn 1s index search slowlog threshold query info 500ms index search slowlog threshold query debug 1500ms index search slowlog threshold query trace 300ms index search slowlog threshold fetch warn 500ms index search slowlog threshold fetch info 400ms index search slowlog threshold fetch debug 300ms index search slowlog threshold fetch trace 200ms hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 20 11 30 18 31 p  Elasticsearch - A High Level Overview of Elasticsearch"

  "body": " GCP AEAD SQL Encryption A walk through using the AEAD SQL encryption functions Private Beta as off Nov 2018 In this example I encrypt some PPI data person name I encrypt each name twice - The first encryption uses a key which is unique to the person and is stored in a parallel person key table This type of encryption is a great way to implement the GDPR right to be forgotten rule To forget a person we don t need to locate and delete all PPI records in all tables we just need to delete the person key record The renders all the person data encrypted using the person key unreadable - The second encryption uses a key unique to the field in the person record This key is passed as a parameter into the read write SQL This key can be stored outside of GCP or in a different project If this key is protected using a different authentication process this gives cryptographically secured two factor authentication Step 1 Create a keyset JSON string to use in following queries to encrypt

Contained within in a project - Global Scope - Two VMs on same network and communicate using internal IP addresses even if they are in different regions - Two VMS in the same region but on different networks must use external IP addresses to communicate Note - this does not mean they go over the internet but to Google edge routers - Subnets in regions and Subnets can span zones Subnet are an IP address range - Have routing tables to forward traffic - Have a global firewalls - Have define rules based on metadata tags eg tag all web servers as web and open all port 80 on these - VPC peering - allow two VPC to share traffic - Shared VPC VPC Types Default - Every project - One subnet per region - Default firewalls Auto Mode - Default Networking - One subnet per region - Regional IP allocation - Fixed 20 subnet per region - In the 10 128 0 0 9 cidr block - Expandable to 16 Customer Mode - No default subnets -

  "body": " Instance Groups Two Types of Instance Groups Managed Identical VMs created using an instance template - Features Auto scaling auto healing and managed releases - All instances must be same machine type Unmanaged Different configuration for VMs in same group - Does NOT offer auto scaling auto healing other services - NOT Recommended unless you need different kinds of VMs Can be in a single Zone or over a Region Managed Instance Groups - Maintain certain number of instances If an instance crashes MIG launches another instance - Detect application failures using health checks Self Healing - Increase and decrease instances based on load Auto Scaling - Add Load Balancer to distribute load - Create instances in multiple zones regional MIGs - Regional MIGs provide higher availability compared to zonal MIGs - Release new application versions without downtime - Rolling updates Release new version step by step gradually Update a percentage of instances to the new version at a time - Canary Deployment Test new version with a group of instances before releasing it across all instances Auto Scaling Can configure - Minimum number of instances - Maximum number of instances - Autoscaling metrics - CPU Utilization target or Load Balancer Utilization target or Any other metric from Stack Driver - Cool-down period How long to wait before looking at auto scaling metrics again to prevent frequent scaling up down - Scale In Controls Prevent a sudden drop in no of VM instances Example Don t scale in by more than 10 or 3 instances in 5 minutes Rolling Updates - Replace instance template with a new template - Can replace instances create new delete old - Can restart instances so instance will be temporarily unavailable - Can use canary testing test n instances and if good update all - Maximum surge How many instances are added at any point in time how many temporary additional instances above the current number - Maximum unavailable How many instances can be offline during the update set this to 0 for no reduction in capacity - therefore new instances added before current instances removed Cloud Load Balancing Distributes user traffic across instances of an application in single region or multiple regions - Fully distributed software defined managed service - Important Features - Health check - Route to healthy instances - Recover from failures - Auto Scaling - Global load balancing with single anycast IP Also supports internal load balancing - Enables - High Availability - Auto Scaling - Resiliency - Load balancer can be - HTTP s - TCP TCP LB SSL proxy TCP proxy - UDP single region only - Load balance can be - Internal - External external IP - Can load balance based on - Instance Utilization - Request Rate ie maximum requests per second per instance Need to Configure - Backend - Group of endpoints that receive traffic from a Google Cloud load balancer example instance groups - Note can have multiple backends multiple instance groups - Frontend - Specify an IP address port and protocol This IP address is the frontend IP for your clients requests - For SSL a certificate must also be assigned - Host and path rules For HTTP S Load Balancing - Define rules redirecting the traffic to different backends - Based on path - xxx com a vs xxx com b - Based on Host - a xxx com vs b xxx com - Based on HTTP headers Authorization header and methods POST GET etc - etc SSL TLS Termination Offloading - Client to LB HTTPS TLS - LB to VM HTTP TCP LB is performing Termination Offloading This reduces load on the VM instances as they don t need to manage SSL Choosing a Load Balancer https cloud google com load-balancing images choose-lb svg https cloud google com load-balancing images choose-lb svg Cloud Load Balancing Features Load Balancer Traffic Type Proxy Pass-through Dest Ports External HTTP S Global External HTTP S Proxy HTTP 80 8080 HTTPS 443 Internal HTTP S Regional Internal HTTP S Proxy HTTP 80 8080 HTTPS 443 SSL Proxy Global External TCP with SSL offload Proxy Many TCP Proxy Global External TCP without SSL offload Proxy Many External NW TCP UDP Regional External TCP UDP Pass-through Any Internal NW TCP UDP Regional Internal TCP UDP Pass-through Any Load Balancing Across Multiple Instance Groups in Multiple regions - Regional MIG can distribute instances in different zones of a single region in the same project - HTTP S Load Balancing can distribute load to the multiple MIGs behind a single external IP address - User requests are redirected to the nearest region Low latency - Load balancing sends traffic to healthy instances - If health check fails instances are restarted Ensure that health check from load balancer can reach the instances in an instance group Firewall rules - If all backends within a region are unhealthy traffic is distributed to healthy backends in other regions - Note Can contain preemptible instances Load Balancing Scenarios - Backend Service - Group of backends or a bucket Each Backend Service can have multiple backends in multiple regions - Backend - A Managed Instance Group - URL Maps - Route requests to backend services or backend buckets eg - URL service-a maps to Backend Service A - URL service-b maps to Backend Service B Scenario 1 - Multi Regional Microservice - One Backend Service for the Microservice - Multiple Backends one for each MIG in each region - Single URL Map - to the Backend Service - Global routing - you to the nearest regional MIG - Note Needs Premium Networking Tier Standard tier only allows single region Scenario 2 - Multiple Microservices - Multiple Backend Services one per Microservice - multiple Backend each Microservice can have multiple MIGs multiple regions - URL Map for each Microservice backend e g URL service-a Availability - 99 99 - four 9 s availability - 4 5 minutes downtime a month - 99 999 - 26 seconds downtime per month Highly Available Architecture - Multiple Regional Instance Groups for each Microservice - Distribute Load using a Global HTTPS Load Balancing - Configure Health Checks for Instance Group and Load Balancing - Enable Live Migration for VM instances Advantages - Instances distributed across regions - even if a region is down your app is available - Global Load Balancing is highly available - Health checks ensure auto healing Scalability - Vertical Scaling - increase machine size - Horizontal Scaling - auto scale Managed Instance Group distribute load using a Load Balancer Live Migration - Running instance is migrated to another host in the same zone - Does NOT change any attributes or properties of the VM - SUPPORT for instances with local SSDs - NO SUPPORT for GPUs and preemptible instances Availability Policy - On host maintenance What should happen during periodic infrastructure maintenance - Migrate default Migrate VM instance to other hardware - Terminate Stop the VM instance required for VMs with GPU - Automatic restart - Restart VM instances if they are terminated due to non-user-initiated reasons maintenance event hardware failure etc Security - Use Firewall Rules to restrict traffic - Use Internal IP Addresses as much as possible - Use Sole-tenant nodes when you have regulatory needs - Create a hardened custom image to launch your VMs Performance - Use GPUs to accelerate machine learning and data processing workloads - Use TPUs for massive matrix operations performed in your machine learning workloads - Prefer creating a hardened custom image to installing software at startup Resiliency - Build Resilient Architectures run VMs in MIG behind global load balancing - Have the right data available - Use Cloud Monitoring for monitoring - Install logging agent to send logs to Cloud Logging - Be prepared for the unexpected and changes - Enable Live Migration and Automatic restart when available - Configure the right health checks - DR- Up to date image copied to multiple regions Sustained Use Discounts - Automatic discounts for running VM instances for significant portion of the billing month - Example If you use N1 N2 machine types for more than 25 of a month you get a 20 to 50 discount on every incremental minute -

  "body": " GCP VPC Networks Overview - VPCs are owned by projects - VPCs connect instances to each other and to the internet VPCs have global scope - VPC subnets can span zones - they have regional scope - Routing Tables created automatically - Firewalls - Global distributed firewall created automatically - Rules can use meta data tags for rules eg open port 80 for all instances tagged web - In a VPC Firewall everything is block by default not open by default as perhaps my PC - VPC Peering - VPCs in different projects can talk via VPC Peering - Shared VPC - Can create shared VPC where IAM controls access - Cloud load balancing - Single anycast IP address balanced across all instances - Load-balancing options - Global Global HTTP S or Global SSL Proxy Global TCP Proxy only work of specific port numbers for TCP - Regional Regional Regional Internal - Cloud DNS - Managed programmable same solutions as Google public DNS 8 8 8 8 - Cloud CDN Content Delivery Network - Edge caches allow you to move content close to users Activate with a check box - Can create a VPC network with Private Google Access which allows access to all the public facing GCP tools like Cloud Storage but without the tools public IP address VPC Networks - VPC can span regions without connecting to public internet Googles own network - Can expand CIDR Classless Inter-Domain Routing - a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing ranges without downtime - Cloud Router Enable dynamic Border Gateway Protocol BGP route updates between VPC network and non-Google network with the virtual router - VPN Securely connect your existing network to VPC network over IPsec - Firewall Segment your networks with a global distributed firewall to restrict access to instances - VPC Peering Configure private communication across the same or different organizations without bandwidth bottlenecks or single points of failure - Shared VPC VPC Network can be shared across many projects in an organization Connectivity routes and firewalls associated are managed centrally - Routes Forward traffic from one instance to another instance within the same network even across subnets without requiring external IP addresses - VPC Flow Logs Flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces on Google Compute Engine VPC flow logs help with network monitoring forensics real-time security analysis and expense optimization - Alias IP ranges If you have multiple services running on a single VM instance you can give each service a different internal IP address using Alias IP Ranges The VPC network forwards packets destined for each configured alias IP to the corresponding VM - Load balancing - Global external load balancing including HTTP S load balancing SSL Proxy and TCP Proxy offerings - Regional external network load balancing - Regional internal load balancing - Private Google Access Instances in a subnet of a VPC network can communicate with Google APIs and services using private IP addresses instead of external IP addresses when you enable Private Google Access for the subnet Network Tags - These are tag which can be added to VMs to allow firewall rules etc to be set for specific sets of VMs Subnets - Subnets are regional resources - are associated to a region Each subnet defines a range of IP addresses - All subnets within a VPC must have unique IP addresses - Subnets in different VPC can share IP addresses even if in same project Routes - Routes define paths for data leaving network egress Can be system generated or custom - Every VPC has two system generated routes - default route - connection to internet also used for Private Google Access path Can delete this - subnet route - created for each IP range in a subnet - Custom routes - Cannot match or be more specific than any subnet route in the network - Static routes - Dynamic routes are managed by Cloud Routers Always to IP outside VPC and are always Border Gateway Protocol BGP addresses Dynamic Routing - Each VPC network has a dynamic routing mode that controls the behaviour of all if its Cloud Routers Cloud Routers share routes to VPC network and learn custom dynamic routes from connected networks Cloud VPN tunnel using dynamic routing Dedicated Interconnect or Partner Interconnect - Regional dynamic routing is the default Routes to on-premises resources learned by Cloud Router in the VPC only apply to the subnets in the same region as the Cloud Router Unless modified by custom advertisements each Cloud Router only shares the routes to subnets in its region with its on-premises counterpart - Global dynamic routing changes the behaviour of all Cloud Routers in the VPC such that the routes to on-premises resources that they learn are available in all of subnets in the VPC network regardless of region Unless modified by custom advertisements each Cloud Router shares routes to all subnets in the VPC network with its on-premises counterpart Applicable Routes Routes apply to instances according to the following rules - System routes apply to all instances in a VPC network The instances to which subnet routes apply cannot be altered but can replace the default route - Custom static routes can apply to all or specific instances - Static routes with a tag attribute apply to instances that have the network tag If no tag the static route applies to all instances in the network - Dynamic routes apply to instances based on the dynamic routing mode of the VPC network - If the VPC network is in regional dynamic routing mode all Cloud Routers apply routes they learn within their respective regions - If the network is in global dynamic routing mode all Cloud Routers apply routes they learn in the whole network - GCP ignores custom routes if their next hops are not available Routing order GCP uses the following procedure to select the next hop for a packet from the pool of applicable routes - Subnet routes are considered first because GCP requires that subnet routes have the most specific destinations matching the IP address ranges of their subnets - GCP does not allow a static route to have an equal or more specific destination than a subnet route - For dynamic routes every Cloud Router ignores any routes it receives that have equal or more specific destinations than any subnet route - If the packet does not fit in the destination for a subnet route GCP looks for another route with the most specific destination - Example For destination 10 240 1 4 - 10 240 1 0 24 is more specific than 10 240 0 0 16 - If more than one route has equal most specific route then route priority considered - If more than one matches the traffic distributed - If no applicable destination is found GCP drops the packet replying with an ICMP destination or network unreachable error Static route parameters Each static route consists of the following components - Name and Description A unique within project name is required but a description is optional - Network Each route must be associated with exactly one VPC network - Destination range The destination range is a single IPv4 CIDR block containing the IP addresses of systems that receive incoming packets - Priority Lower numbers indicate higher priorities - Next hop Static routes can have next hops that point to the default Internet gateway a GCP instance or a Cloud VPN tunnel - Tags You can specify a list of network tags so that the route will only apply to instances that have at least one of the listed tags Static Route Next Hops The following are valid next hops for static routes - Next Hop Gateway You can specify a default Internet gateway to define a path to public IP addresses - Next Hop Instance You can direct traffic to an existing instance in GCP by specifying the name and zone of the instance Traffic is directed to the primary internal IP address in the network - Next Hop IP You can reference an existing instance in GCP using the internal IP address of its primary network interface - Next Hop VPN Tunnel For Cloud VPN tunnels using policy based routing and route based VPNs you can direct traffic to the VPN tunnel by creating routes whose next hops refer to the tunnel by its name and region Instances as Next Hops When creating a static routes whose next hop is an instance either by virtue of using next hop instance or next hop IP the instance acting as the next hop must be configured to receive incoming traffic from other instances Firewalls - Firewall rules apply to both outgoing egress and incoming ingress traffic in the network - Firewall rules control traffic even if it is entirely within the network such as instance-to-instance communication - Every VPC network has two implied firewall rules - Allow all egress traffic destination 0 0 0 0 0 all IP priority 65535 lowest possible - Deny all ingress traffic destination 0 0 0 0 0 all IP priority 65535 lowest possible - Cannot delete the implied rules but you can override them with your own - Firewalls specify - Priority determines if the rule will be applied The highest priority lowest priority number wins - The direction of traffic ingress incoming egress outgoing - Action on match either allow or deny which determines if the rule permits or blocks traffic - A target instances including GKE clusters and App Engine Flex instances to which the rule will apply - A source for ingress rules or a destination for egress rules IP range - The protocol such as TCP UDP or ICMP and port number e g TCP 22 ICMP TCP 0-65534 all ports Default Network - Comes with 17 subnets 1 for each region - IP Range for eg us-west-1 - 10 138 0 0 20 so Min IP 10 138 0 0 Max IP 10 138 31 255 - Default firewalls allows comms between all instances on VPC egress to internet and ingress on port 3389 rdp and port 22 ssh Shared VPC Networks - Shared VPC allows networks to be managed separately to creating and managing instances VMs - VPC can only be shared within an Organisation - Host Project owns Shared VPC Service Projects use Shared VPC A Project cannot be both A Standalone Project is neither - A Service Project can only connect to a single Shared VPC - When Host Project is enabled all existing and future VPC are shared - Billing is attributed to the Service Projects - External IP addresses defined in the host project are only usable by resources in that project They are not available for use in service projects - Internal DNS - project ids used in DNS names are that of the service project Eg - Internal Zonal DNS INSTANCE NAME ZONE c SERVICE PROJECT ID internal - Internal Global DNS INSTANCE NAME c SERVICE PROJECT ID internal Shared VPC Administration - Shared VPC Admins have the Shared VPC Admin compute xpnAdmin role for the org They can - Enable host projects - Attach service projects to host projects - Delegate access to some or all of the subnets in Shared VPC networks to Service Project Admins - A Shared VPC Admin for a given host project is typically its project owner as well - A Shared VPC Admin can define Service Project Admin by granting Network User compute networkUser role to - The whole host project - Select subnets of its Shared VPC networks - A Shared VPC Admin can make an IAM member a - Network Admin by granting the Network Admin compute networkAdmin role to the host project Network Admins have full control over all network resources except for firewall rules and SSL certificates - Security Admin by granting the Security Admin compute securityAdmin role to the host project Security Admins manage firewall rules and SSL certificates VPC Network Peering VPC Network Peering allows private RFC 1918 connectivity across two VPC networks regardless of whether or not they belong to the same project or the same organization For multiple network administrative domains within an organization VPC Network Peering makes services available across VPC networks in private RFC 1918 space Peered VPC networks - VPC Network Peering works with Compute Engine Kubernetes Engine and App Engine flexible environment - Routes firewalls VPNs and other traffic management tools are administered and applied separately in each VPC network - Each side of a peering association is set up independently - A given VPC network can peer with multiple VPC networks but there is a limit - A subnet CIDR prefix in one peered VPC network cannot overlap with a subnet CIDR prefix in another peered network This means that two auto mode VPC networks that only have the default subnets cannot peer GCP checks for overlap in the following circumstances - When you peer VPC networks for the first time - When you create a new subnet in a peered VPC network - A subnet CIDR range in one peered VPC network cannot overlap a route in another peered network This rule covers both subnet routes and custom routes GCP checks for overlap in the following circumstances and generates an error when an overlap occurs - When you peer VPC networks for the first time - When you create a static route in a peered VPC network - When you create a new subnet in a peered VPC network - IAM Permissions There are new IAM permissions for creating and deleting VPC Network Peering - Once networks have peered every internal private IP is accessible across peered networks - The following types of endpoints resources are reachable across directly peered networks - Virtual machine VM internal IPs in all subnets - Internal load balanced IPs in all subnets - The following types of endpoints resources are NOT propagated to directly peered networks - Static routes - VPNs - Only directly peered networks can communicate Transitive peering is not supported No route to C via B etc - Peering traffic traffic flowing between peered networks has the same latency throughput and availability as private traffic in the same network - Billing policy for peering traffic remains unchanged from billing policy for private traffic in same network Walk-through Of Network Operation VM Instance 1 Wants to send packet of data to Instance 2 using server name - Inst 1 Calls DNS on its metadata server and gets back IP address - Inst 1 Checks if IP address in address range on its subnet all instances know subnet range - If the IP address is outside the VPC network - Inst 1 sends the packet to the subnet s gateway MAC address with the destination set to the packet s final destination The instance might need to make an ARP Address Resolution Protocol request to resolve the gateway s MAC address - The VPC rewrites IP header to declare the instance s external IP address as the source If the instance has no external IP address the call is not allowed and the VPC network drops the packet without informing the sender - The VPC network records the outgoing packet and adds the source and destination to the active connections table - The VPC network sends the packet on to its destination - The destination gets the packet and responds if it chooses - The VPC receives the response consults the active connections table notes that this is an active connection and allows it The VPC network consults its network external IP lookup table and replaces the instance s external IP address with the matching network address and sends the packet to the source instance - The instance receives the packet - If the destination IP address is within the VPC network - The instance is configured with an IP with 255 255 255 255 mask so the instance sends the packet to the subnet s gateway MAC address The instance first might need to make an ARP request to resolve the gateway s MAC address - The VPC network using Proxy ARP responds with the MAC address of the destination instance - GCP forwards the packet to the destination IP within the VPC network - The target instance receives the packet The target instance checks ingress firewall to determine if packet is allowed If not the packet is dropped silently Otherwise the instance processes the packet An external instance or computer calls an instance - The external caller sends a packet to an instance s external IP address which is owned by the VPC network - The VPC network compares the packet against the active connections table to see whether this is an existing connection - If it is not an existing connection then the VPC network looks for a firewall rule to allow the connection - If there is no firewall rule the VPC network drops the packet without informing the sender - If there is an existing connection or valid firewall rule the VPC network examines its lookup table and replaces the external IP with the corresponding internal IP in the packet logs the incoming packet in the active connections table and sends the packet to the target instance - The instance receives the packet and responds as described in If the IP address is outside the VPC network IP range above - The VPC network receives the reply finds the matching incoming request in the active connections table and allows the packet through Before sending it modifies the source IP address by replacing the instance s internal IP with the corresponding external IP from its lookup table Connecting to GCP GCP Interconnection Options - VPN - IPSec protocol - Can use Cloud Router - Direct Peering - Private connect between you Google for hybrid cloud networks Connection in a data centre where GCP has a point of presence - Carrier Peering - Connect through the largest partner network of service providers - Dedicated Interconnect - 10G transport circuits to Google Cloud at Google POPs VPC Service Controls - Private Beta as of Nov-2018 VPC Service Controls allow users to define a security perimeter around Google Cloud Platform resources such as Cloud Storage buckets Bigtable instances and BigQuery datasets to constrain data within a VPC and help mitigate data ex filtration risks With VPC Service Controls enterprises can keep their sensitive data private as they take advantage of the fully managed storage and data processing capabilities of Google Cloud Platform This means we can - Define security perimeters for sensitive data in Google Cloud Platform services - Establish virtual security perimeters for API-based services - We can limit access to data in BigQuery to users connected via a specific VPC hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 20 09 07 12 56 p  GCP -

typically 50 wider than tall Eye is naturally practised in detecting deviations from the horizon Where the X and Y axis values are compared for example in scatter plot then the Chart can be square to avoid any bias Axis Labels Avoid overlapping labels -

  "body": "section Misc Today I was looking at authentication for a web-service It was using JSON Web Tokens What are JWTs How do they work A JWT is a cryptographically signed JSON token used to authenticate users making calls to an application A JWT is sent to a user when they authenticate with an authentication Service The user can send this token with requests to an application web-service or other as proof of identity The application talks to the authentication server and is told the how the token was cryptographically signed and the key used This allows the application to be sure that the token is valid and originated from the authentication service Two types of cryptographic signatures can be used - Symmetric hash algorythm - where the same key is used to sign and assure the JWT - Asymmetric hash algorythm public private key - Where a private key is used to sign the JWT and a public key is used to assure the JWT Symmetric hashes are much quicker to compute than Asymmetric hashes but mean the secret key will need to be shared with all applications which need to authenticate users The contents of a JWT A JWT is made up from 3 components Header The header describes how the JWT was computed A typical header will contain typ JWT alg HS256 The key value typ specifies that this is a JWT The key value alg specifies that this JWT was signed using the symmetric HMAC-SHA256 algorithm The header JSON is converted to a url encoded string using base64urlEncode Payload also called the Claims The payload contains the information which is asserted claimed to be true This could contain userId martin-98999394 exp 15634343 The free form key value userId could specify the Id of the user which the JWT asserts is authorised A request from that userId along with the JWT would authenticate that user The key value exp which is one of a set of standard keys specifies when the JWT expires The payload JSON is converted to a url encoded string using base64urlEncode Signature The signature is created by appending the payload url encoded string to the header url encoded string separated by a and then hashing this value using the specified algorithm and secret The hash value is then also converted to a url encoded string using base64urlEncode and then append to the header payload string again separated by a Creating the JWT using a symmetric hash algorithm As pseudo we have body base64urlEncode headerJSON base64urlEncode payloadJSON signature base64urlEncode hash algorithm body secret key JWT body signature The JWT will look something like eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9 eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJiMDhmODZhZi0zNWRhLTQ4ZjItO GZhYi1jZWYzOTA0NjYwYmQifQ NOTE - The payload is NOT encrypted it is simply converted to base64url encoding and can be reversed - If the contents of the JWT are modified in anyway then the signature will not longer match the contents Assuring the JWT The application to which the JWT is passed to authenticate the user will split JWT header payload signature body header payload new signature base64urlEncode hash algorithm body secret key if new signature matches signature then JWT is valid NOTE - The JWT assurance process recomputes the hash of header and payload using the same secret key as the process that created the JWT - The payload can now be converted back to JSON to allow the application to check it has not expired and to get the authenticated userId - If the secret key is known by a third party the third party can also create valid JWTs so the secret must not be shared Using an Asymmetric Hash Algorithm When symmetric hash algorithms are used the authentication service needs to share the secret key used to create the signature with the applications services which need to assure the JWT This is a security risk as the key could be maliciously use to create new JWTs An Asymmetric encryption algorithm allows the signature to be created encrypted using a private key when the JWT is created To assure the JWT the application service can decrypt the signature using the public key The application can then compare this to the header and payload to assure the JWT is valid As pseudo code Creating a JWT body base64urlEncode headerJSON base64urlEncode payloadJSON signature base64urlEncode hash algorithm encode body private key JWT body signature Assuring the JWT split JWT header payload signature body header payload decoded signature hash algorithm decode base64urlDecode signature public key if decoded signature matches the body then JWT is valid In this case we can be sure that the service which created the JWT knows the private key For the signature to be successfully decrypted using the public key it MUST of be created using the private key hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 24 05 17 16 27 p  Misc - JWT - JSON Web Tokens"

  "body": " What is Public Private Key Encryption This process uses an algorithm that can encrypt data using a public key however the data can only be decrypted using a private key I share my public key with everyone and they use it to encrypt data they send to me Only I can decrypt and read that data The Analogy As an analogy to public private key encryption consider a secure locked post-box which contains a slot through which notes can be posted Notes posted in to the post-box cannot be read as with encryption To read the notes decrypt the data the post-box must first be unlocked The post-box will be identified by an id number key The post-box is one of a billion billion billion or more identical post-boxes stored in a shared location The only means of identifying the correct post-box is by the post-box Id When a note is posted into the locked post-box the note can t be read and is secure The process of posting a note into the post-box is synonymous to encrypting the data using the post-box id public key The only way to access notes in the post-box is by unlocking the post-box This means unlocking the post-box using the lock code private key The notes can then be read which is synonymous to decrypting the data The analogy fails because the notes have to be taken to the shared location for the post-box and posted Notes will also need to be taken from shared location to the location of the individual who wants to read the notes Whilst the notes are in transit the contents are insecure We can extend the analogy to solve this issue Let s say we can request a new post-box each time we need to post a note encrypt data We state the post-box Id and the post-box comes locked using the same unlock code private key as used in other post-boxes with the same Id Key Once we have a post-box we post the note s into the locked post-box and then send the post-box to a shared location The note is secure during transit When we want to access and read the notes we request that all the post-boxes with my public Id Key are sent to our location the notes will be secure in transit We can then un-lock the post-boxes and read the notes decrypt the data Before the post-boxes are sent to us a copy will be made of the post-boxes without unlocking them simple with software - impossible with our physical post-boxes hr p class pagedate This page was generated by a href GitHub Pages a Page last modified 20 11 30 18 32 p  Misc - Public Key Encryption Analogy"

  "body": "section Misc For a long time I ve wanted to explore using statistics to determine how many tests are needed to test for errors The question I have is that for a set of n records if we want to be say 99 9 sure none contain an error how many would be need to test at random to reach a point where we can be statistically say 99 9 sure there are no errors The Basics Tests with a fixed number of options records to test If I have a die and there is a chance the number has not been printed on one side how many times would I need to roll the die to be 99 sure all sides contain a number Lets assume there is a fault on one side of the die and I can only see the top face of the die each time I roll it - how many times would I need to roll the die to be 99 sure I ll find it This isn t easy to calculate We need to work out all the combinations of die sides on top after n throws These will include throws with our bad side on top First Roll - 6 options 1 is the bad side so chance of finding it is 1 6 Calculation - 1 6 16 7 Second Roll - If role 1 finds a bad side then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If roll one finds a good side there is a 5 6 chance of this we roll again - The second roll has a 1 6 chance of being bad Calculation - 1 6 5 6 x 1 6 30 6 Third Roll - If role 1 finds a bad side then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If roll 1 finds a good side there is a 5 6 chance of this we roll again - Roll 2 roll has a 1 6 chance of being bad if we find bad side we stop - If role 2 finds a good side there is a 5 6 chance of this we roll again - Roll 3 has a 1 6 chance of being bad Calculation - 1 6 5 6 x 1 6 5 6 x 1 6 42 1 This gets very complicated very quick However this question can be reversed and instead we can ask - What is the chance that each time I roll the die I won t find the bad side For each roll of the die there is a 5 6 83 3 chance I won t find the bad side and that is true for every roll of the die regardless of the outcome of any earlier rolls However if we ask the question up front What is the chance I won t find the bad side within say 3 rolls then the maths is slightly different For 3 planned rolls the chance I won t find the faulty side is 5 6 x 5 6 x 5 6 125 216 57 9 This means the chance that I will find the faulty side is 100 - 57 9 42 1 This matches the value calculated above So lets see how many times I would need to plan to roll the die to be 99 sure I ll find the faulty side Roll Number Chance Wont Find Chance Will Find ------------- --------------------------------------- ---------------------- 1 5 6 83 3 16 7 2 5 6 x 5 6 5 6 sup 2 sup 69 4 30 6 3 5 6 sup 3 sup 57 9 98 5 24 5 6 sup 24 sup 1 5 98 5 25 5 6 sup 25 sup 1 3 98 7 26 5 6 sup 26 sup 1 0 99 0 A surprisingly large number This number is large because the number of options sides to land face up for each roll remains the same We can never rule out and remove any side from the next roll Tests with a reducing number of options records to test If we swap the die analogy for a bag containing six balls where ideally all the balls in the bag are white but there is a possibility that one of the balls is black how many balls would I need to take out of the bag to be 99 sure there are no black balls The statistics here are slightly different and there is also the obvious upper limit Once I have removed all the balls 6 balls 6 tests if they are all white I can be 100 sure there no black balls Let s assume one ball is black and do the do the math Again we focus on the chance of finding the bad ball which is far more simple in terms of the math Looking at each test in turn Ball 1 - For ball 1 taken from the bag there is a 1 6 chance it will be black Calculation 1 6 16 7 Ball 2 - If ball 1 is black then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If ball 1 is white there is a 5 6 chance of this we take out ball 2 - For ball 2 there is a 1 5 chance of it being black Calculation 1 6 5 6 x 1 5 33 3 Ball 3 - If ball 1 is black then we stop there is a 1 6 chance of this - If ball 1 is white there is a 5 6 chance of this we take ball 2 - Ball 2 has a 1 5 chance of being black if we find it we stop - If ball 2 is white there is a 4 5 chance of this we take ball 3 - Ball 3 has a 1 6 chance of being black Calculation 1 6 5 6 x 1 5 4 5 x 1 4 55 3 Again using the won t find calculation and asking the question up front how many balls will I need to remove to be 99 sure there isn t a black ball the math is Ball Number Chance Wont Find Chance Will Find ------------- --------------------------------------- -------------------- 1 83 3 5 6 16 7 2 66 7 5 6 x 4 5 33 3 3 50 0 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 50 0 4 33 3 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 x 2 3 66 7 5 16 7 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 x 2 3 x 1 2 83 3 6 0 5 6 x 4 5 x 3 4 x 2 3 x 1 2 x 0 1 100 The number of balls is too small to get to 99 we hit 100 first Here s What We Know So Far If we choose a percentage p likelihood of there being a bad side bad ball bad record in a set we can calculate how many records we need to look at to be t sure we will find it and if we don t find it we can be 100 - t sure it doesn t exist The maths differs depending on whether we can or can t remove each record from the set if we test it and its good The above examples had a set of 6 sides items records and the two records remain or removed equations gave very different results but as the set side increases the difference between the 2 should decrease Lets write a python program to test this assumption The Python programs is stats test py attatchments stats test py The Statistics Running stats test py python3 stats test py Usage 1 stats test py bad record perc set size target certainty perc 2 stats test py -g 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Where 1 - number bad record percentage rows in grid 2 - bad record percentage min 3 - bad record percentage max 4 - number target certainty percentage columns in grid 5 - target certainty percentage min 6 - target certainty percentage max 7 - test data set size 3 stats test py -t num test sets bad rec perc set size num of tests Percentages perc in range 0 - 100 Let s calculate the die balls in a bag scenario above python3 stats test py 16 667 6 99 bad record likelihood 16 667 set size 6 target certainty 99 0 With good recs removed - reached target certainty 99 0 after 6 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 0 after 26 tests Now lets calculate something a little more useful Assuming we have 100 000 000 records and we want to be 99 99 sure the risk of an error is less than 0 01 python3 stats test py 0 01 100000000 99 99 bad record likelihood 0 01 set size 100000000 target certainty 99 99 With good recs removed - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92057 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92099 tests So we need to test a little over 92 000 records chosen at random from 100 000 000 records to be 99 99 sure there is less than 0 01 of records in error Also note that with this large set size the difference between the number of tests required if the good records are left in or removed is negligible Lets try a larger set size 100 000 000 000 python3 stats test py 0 01 100000000000 99 99 bad record likelihood 0 01 set size 100000000000 target certainty 99 99 With good recs removed - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92099 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92099 tests What s interesting here is that the number if tests with good records remaining in the data set is the same even though we have 1 000x more records This surprised me at first but the reason is obvious once seen As we are stating the max likelihood of there being a bad records as a percentage of the total data set as the set size increase so does the number of bad records If we reduce the bad record likelihood percentage value by a factor of 1 000 so that the max number of bad records in the same as was in the 100 000 000 test set then the number of test should go up python3 stats test py 0 00001 100000000000 99 99 bad record likelihood 1e-05 set size 100000000000 target certainty 99 99 With good recs removed - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92060997 tests With good recs remaining - reached target certainty 99 99 after 92103400 tests The number of tests does go up a lot Double Checking These Results Lets check the math is correct by simulating a real scenario I wrote a function in stats test py to do this Below I calculate the test required for a few different scenarios and then test the values Scenario 1 Calculate number of tests python3 stats test py 0 01 1000000 99 9 bad record likelihood 0 01 set size 1000000 target certainty 99 9 With good recs removed -

however we could check by pulling the master branch again from GitHub Switch back to the master branch in local Git and run a pull from GitHub to make sure this is up to date git-test user2 git checkout master Switched to branch master Your branch is up-to-date with origin master git-test user2 git pull origin master From https github com mjnurse git-test branch master -

return this and type tags and optionally on const export and any visibility tags Type annotations attached to JSDoc tags must always be enclosed in braces 7 10 1 Nullability The type system defines modifiers and for non-null and nullable respectively These modifiers must precede the type Nullability modifiers have different requirements for different types which fall into two broad categories Type annotations for primitives string number boolean symbol undefined null and literals function and foo string are always non-nullable by default Use the modifier to make it nullable but omit the redundant Reference types generally anything in UpperCamelCase including some namespace ReferenceType refer to a class enum record or typedef defined elsewhere Since these types may or may not be nullable it is impossible to tell from the name alone whether it is nullable or not Always use explicit and modifiers for these types to prevent ambiguity at use sites Bad const MyObject myObject null Non-primitive types must be annotated const number someNum 5 Primitives are non-nullable by default const number someNullableNum null should precede the type const foo string bar number record Already non-nullable const MyTypeDef def Not sure if MyTypeDef is nullable Not sure if object nullable enum non-nullable unless otherwise specified or typedef depends on definition const SomeCamelCaseName n Good const MyObject myObject null const number someNum 5 const number someNullableNum null const foo string bar number record const MyTypeDef def const SomeCamelCaseName n 7 10 2 Type Casts In cases where the compiler doesn t accurately infer the type of an expression and the assertion functions in goog asserts cannot remedy it it is possible to tighten the type by adding a type annotation comment and enclosing the expression in parentheses Note that the parentheses are required type number x 7 10 3 Template Parameter Types Always specify template parameters This way compiler can do a better job and it makes it easier for readers to understand what code does Bad const Object users const Array books const Promise response Good const Object string User users const Array string books const Promise Response response const Promise undefined thisPromiseReturnsNothingButParameterIsStillUseful const Object string mapOfEverything Cases when template parameters should not be used Object is used for type hierarchy and not as map-like structure 7 10 4 Function type expressions Terminology Note function type expression refers to a type annotation for function types with the keyword function in the annotation see examples below Where the function definition is given do not use a function type expression Specify parameter and return types with param and return or with inline annotations see 7 8 Method and function comments This includes anonymous functions and functions defined and assigned to a const where the function jsdoc appears above the whole assignment expression Function type expressions are needed for example inside typedef param or return Use it also for variables or properties of function type if they are not immediately initialized with the function definition private function string string this idGenerator googFunctions identity When using a function type expression always specify the return type explicitly Otherwise the default return type is unknown which leads to strange and unexpected behavior and is rarely what is actually desired param function inputFunction1 Can return any type param function undefined inputFunction2 Definitely doesn t return anything NOTE the return type of foo itself is safely implied to be undefined function foo inputFunction1 inputFunction2 7 10 5 Whitespace Within a type annotation a single space or line break is required after each comma or colon Additional line breaks may be inserted to improve readability or avoid exceeding the column limit These breaks should be chosen and indented following the applicable guidelines e g 4 5 Line-wrapping and 4 2 Block indentation 2 spaces No other whitespace is allowed in type annotations Good type function string number type foo number bar number type number string type Object string string type function this Object string string number string type function SuperDuperReallyReallyLongTypedefThatForcesTheLineBreak OtherVeryLongTypedef string type SuperDuperReallyReallyLongTypedefThatForcesTheLineBreak OtherVeryLongTypedef Bad Only put a space after the colon type function string number Put spaces after colons and commas type foo number bar number No space in union types type number string 7 11 Visibility annotations Visibility annotations private package protected may be specified in a fileoverview block or on any exported symbol or property Do not specify visibility for local variables whether within a function or at the top level of a module All private names must end with an underscore Some document generation tool will ignore plain test formatting to use Markdown lists etc Computes weight based on three factors items sent items received last timestamp Might generate Computes weight based on three factors items sent items
