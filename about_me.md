**(From LinkedIn)**

I am an accomplished Data Solution Architect with an innovative, hands-on, straightforward approach to design and delivery. I have over 18 years experience working in Financial Services, National Security, Telecoms and New Media. I have in depth knowledge of the Google Cloud Platform, Hadoop ecosystem, Oracle and Teradata databases. Recently focusing on high volume event processing, Finance and Analytics. I have delivered Big Data, Enterprise Data Warehouse, Analytics and regulatory reporting solutions. I enjoy solving complex problems and delivering the right business requirements with efficient robust solutions. I take pride in delivering high quality applications. I am a certified Agile Scrum Master and DevOps champion.

I have deep expertise in the management of very large data sets and performance tuning techniques that have been critical to the success of many applications. I built Europe's largest Oracle Data Warehouse for a National Security client. Security has been key to may of the applications I have delivered and I understand the complexity and challenges and how these can be addressed.

I am confident working closely with the business and technical delivery teams. I believe the line between architect and engineer / developer is a blurred one and I thrive on the opportunity to help deliver the solutions I architect and design.
